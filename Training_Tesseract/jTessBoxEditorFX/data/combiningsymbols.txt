# This UTF-8 encoded text file lets the user specify combining symbols or diacritics
# in Unicode native or escaped forms, such as U+0CCC or \u0CCC,
# that need to be combined with the preceding main/base character.
# Comment lines start with # sign. All the codepoint values should be on one single line, 
# with no spaces or quotes. A dash "-" character indicates a range of values. A semicolon ";"
# separates appending and prepending symbol sequences.
